    <h5>The Moon</h5>
    Well, not exclusively. This section is dedicated to the fields and hobbies
    I'm passionate about, outside of work and the classroom.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Space -- Planet Earth is just one small rock, floating through a vast,
        beautiful sea of stars, galaxies, and worlds which we have yet to
        explore. I'd love to be a part of that exploratory process someday.
      </li>
      <li>
        Music -- Singing while playing piano or guitar is my go-to destressing
        activity. Current favorites: Teleprompter (EMIA) and Grace (Laura
        Story).
      </li>
      <li>
        Cooking -- I love food (who doesn't?), and make most of my meals at
        home. Current favorites: stir-fry napa cabbage and korean egg rolls.
      </li>
