    <h5>Learning</h5>
    I am always lookings to learn new technologies and skills that can
    meaningfully expand my technical 'toolbox'. Here are a couple frameworks I'm
    currently experimenting with:
    <ul>
      <li>
        MongoDB -- I used MongoDB to construct the data end of WhatsForDinner!
        Learning how to make more specialized queries that leverage search
        indexing is on my current TODO list, especially as I hope to grow the
        data set.
      </li>
      <li>
        OpenGL -- One of my favorite parts of software engineering is seeing
        abstract data rendered into tangible, physical components. After taking
        an introductory course last year, I've been learning modern OpenGL (with
        C++), and creating simple 2D and 3D demos.
      </li>
    </ul>
